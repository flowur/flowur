{"name":"flowur","tagline":"Simple flowchart creation and visualization.","body":"The flowur project is a collection of tools aimed at optimizing the creation of flowcharts, diagnostics, and other graph based visualizations. Flowur has two main components: interfaces and templates. Interfaces focus on retrieving user data intuitively and quickly. Templates generate interpretations of the data set they are given.\r\n\r\n###  Interfaces\r\nInterfaces streamline node based data entry and build a JSON file using the flowur markup.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Templates\r\nTemplates consist of routing algorithms, functionality code, and graphical styling. The existing code associated with the flowur project along with the standardized markup makes the process of building a template more focused on realizing the actual concept.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Markup\r\nThe JSON markup consists of a title, nodes, and arrows. Nodes have an 'id', 'data', and a 'type'. Arrows have 'from' and 'to' ids that refer to associated nodes. Currently arrows are generated with an 'isLink' value that denotes a back/forward edge but the team plans to cycle out the usage of this value over the next few weeks.\r\n\r\n\r\n### License\r\nCopyright (c) 2012, flowur\r\nAll rights reserved.\r\n\r\n\r\nRedistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without\r\nmodification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\r\n    * Redistributions of source code must retain the above copyright\r\n      notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer.\r\n    * Redistributions in binary form must reproduce the above copyright\r\n      notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the\r\n      documentation and/or other materials provided with the distribution.\r\n    * Neither the \"Flowur\" name nor the names of its contributors may be \r\n      used to endorse or promote products derived from this software \r\n      without specific prior written permission.\r\n\r\nTHIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND CONTRIBUTORS \"AS IS\" AND\r\nANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED\r\nWARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE\r\nDISCLAIMED.
